          This domain must not be used in your network. Services will be discoverable
          under <service-name>.<namespace>.<domainname>, e.g.
          myservice.default.kube.local
        default: kube.local

          IP address of the DNS server.
          Kubernetes will create a pod with several containers, serving as the DNS
          server and expose it under this IP address. The IP address must be from
          the range specified as kube_service_addresses above.
          And this is the IP address you should use as address of the DNS server
          in your containers.
